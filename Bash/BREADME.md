# Process Files



* Linear Regression


# BASH
# Regr
The program accepts as program parameters a list of files. Assume that each file has lines of the format:
**num1:num2**. Each file should contain at least 3
Lines. The program scan each file to calculate the linear regression parameters a,b,c to minimize the total square error of the **cY=aX+b** approach.




# Results
The program accepts as program parameter a file name. This file will contain rows of the format: **Team1-Team2:Score1-Score2**.
The project calculates the scores and points. The teams must be 
ordered based on scores. The results are exported to file.



Bash scripts have been created in notepadd program.
computeSale has been created in pyCharm.

**Bash script** programs can run in terminal. Execute
**./regr input1 input2 input3**

where **input1,input2,input3** are file names with the specified format for the regression program.


**./results input1**

where **input1** is file name with the specified format for the results program.
